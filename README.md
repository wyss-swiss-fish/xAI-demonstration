# Code for Waldock et al. (submitted) - **Shadow distributions reveal species' spatial sensitivity to anthropogenic threats and ecological constraints**.

This repository contains the code to accompany the analysis contained in Waldock et al. (2023). For convenience, we provide a detailed explanation in the [Appendix 4](https://github.com/wyss-swiss-fish/xAI-demonstration/blob/33e9c0bc6d2541b2bc882d123cc7d9eec4e71769/shapley-values-for-SDMs_reduced.pdf) (see file "Shapey-values-for-SDM_reduced.pdf") that accompanies the submitted manuscript. We expect is more useful to read through the provided summary analysis which contains all the same code to reproduce the work. The raw code files were run on the UBELIX server at University of Bern.
