# Code for Waldock et al. (submitted) *Shadow distributions: Deconstructing the geography of human impacts on species' natural distribution*.

This repository contains the code to accompany the analysis contained in Waldock et al. (2024). For convenience, we provide a detailed explanation in the [Supporting File 2](https://github.com/wyss-swiss-fish/xAI-demonstration/blob/d348eb0a0c1351da28c140adaf214c1c08e504ab/Appendix%204%20Explainable%20AI%20for%20SDMs%20code.pdf) that accompanies the published manuscript. The accompanying data are available on a permanent link at figshare https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.24787227. 

For researchers interested to generate their own _shadow distributions_ or apply XAI to their species distribution models, we expect it is most useful to read through the provided summary analysis which contains all the same code to reproduce the work. For reference, the raw code to follow the production of the figures in the main manuscript are also provided.
