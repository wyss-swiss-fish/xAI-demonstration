# Code for Waldock et al. (submitted) - **Shadow distributions reveal species' spatial sensitivity to anthropogenic threats and ecological constraints**.

This repository contains the code to accompany the analysis contained in Waldock et al. (submitted). For convenience, we provide a detailed explanation in the [Appendix 4](https://github.com/wyss-swiss-fish/xAI-demonstration/blob/d348eb0a0c1351da28c140adaf214c1c08e504ab/Appendix%204%20Explainable%20AI%20for%20SDMs%20code.pdf) that accompanies the submitted manuscript. The accompanying data are too large to provide at github so are available on a permanent link at [figshare](https://figshare.com/account/articles/24511183). We expect is it most useful to read through the provided summary analysis which contains all the same code to reproduce the work. For reference, the raw code to follow the production of the figures in the main manuscript are also provided.
